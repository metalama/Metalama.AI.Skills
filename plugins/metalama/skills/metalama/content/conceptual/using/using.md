# Using Metalama

This chapter is designed for developers who want to _use_ aspects without creating new ones. If that's your goal, you can stop reading after this chapter. However, if you aim to create aspects, starting with this chapter is still beneficial as it introduces core principles and techniques.

By the end of this chapter, you'll feel confident using aspects in your codebase.

## Who should read this chapter?

This chapter is recommended for those who:

- Have recently joined a team that's already using Metalama.
- Plan to use ready-made aspects but don't intend to create their own.
- Intend to create their own aspects in the future, but prefer a gradual approach.
