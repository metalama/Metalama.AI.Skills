# Metalama Documentation

Welcome to the documentation of Metalama, a code generation and analysis framework for C#.

## How to navigate this documentation

There are two types of Metalama users:

* If you're _using aspects written by others_, start with <xref:using-metalama>.
* If you're _developing your own aspects_, start with <xref:main-getting-started> for a quick overview, then move to <xref:using-metalama> and continue to <xref:simple-aspects>.

Each article has a _complexity level_: 100, 200, or 300, following the U.S. school system. Before reading a level 200 article, make sure you understand level 100. We avoid adding complex details to basic-level articles. You may need to read several articles to get comprehensive information on a topic.

## Documentation structure

| Book | Description |
|------|-------------|
| <xref:main-getting-started> | A quick "Hello, world" walkthrough showing how to create a logging aspect and apply a simple architecture validation rule. |
| <xref:conceptual> | Comprehensive reference documentation. |
| <xref:samples> | Commented examples with varying complexity. |
| <xref:api> | API documentation generated from source code. |
