# Flashtrace API

Flashtrace is a logging front-end used by <xref:Metalama.Patterns.Caching>. Don't use this library directly except in explicitly recommended scenarios, such as implementing custom cache key formatters.

> [!NOTE]
> For most caching scenarios, use the high-level caching API described in <xref:caching> instead of directly using Flashtrace.
